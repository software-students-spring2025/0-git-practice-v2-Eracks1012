### Why I Like It
- The Therac-25 incidents are a compelling study in the critical importance of software reliability in medical devices. Between 1985 and 1987, six patients received massive radiation overdoses due to software errors in the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine, leading to severe injuries and fatalities. These accidents underscore the dangers of over-reliance on software without adequate hardware safety interlocks and highlight the consequences of insufficient safety protocols in the development of life-critical systems. I found this article really interesting because it dives into the ethics of coding which we don't usually think about.
